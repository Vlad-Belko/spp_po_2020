You just finished an app. It works fine, but the interface lacks style and grace.
You could give it a makeover by drawing several sizes of custom control images
in Photoshop and hope Apple doesn’t release a @4x retina screen. That plan, however,
lacks strategy and sounds time-consuming. Alternatively, you could use Core Graphics
to create an image that scales crisply for any device size.
Core Graphics is Apple’s vector drawing framework. It’s a big, powerful application
programming interface (API) with many tools to master and cool features like
@IBDesignable and @IBInspectable. But never fear! This three-part series takes
a modern approach to Core Graphics. It starts slow and eases you in with fun,
engaging exercises. By the end, you’ll be able to create stunning graphics for your apps.
So sit back and relax with your favorite beverage. It’s time to learn Core Graphics!
Getting Into the Flo
Imagine a doctor recommends you drink eight glasses of water a day. No problem, you think.
But after a few days, you realize how easy it is to lose track. Did you down three glasses
this afternoon or two? Did you have your water bottle at your desk yesterday or the day before?
In this tutorial, you’ll create an app to track your drinking habits. With it, every time
you polish off a refreshing glass of H2O, you tap a counter button. As data accumulate,
the app will create a graph displaying your weekly consumption.
This app will be named Flo, and here it is in its completed glory:
